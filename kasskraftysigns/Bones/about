        <h2>About me:</h2>

        <div class="aboutText">

            <p>A little about me: My name is Kass, and I am currently living in Boise, Idaho with my cute little family
                of 4.
                I am a huge dog lover, and have 2 dogs of my own-Pres and Pudge. I love the great outdoors, I love being
                out on the lake,
                spending time in my garden, or going on an adventure in the mountains on our Razor.<br><br>
                I started this small business journey 5 years ago-as a stay at home Mom. I was losing a sense of myself.
                I needed a creative outlet to give myself some love. I asked my amazing husband to teach me how to use
                some power tools, and I was set!
                I started cutting, sanding, staining and painting my own hand painted wood signs!
                With time and more knowledge, my hobby grew to a small business where friends and family started
                ordering my work,
                and then strangers became friends and I was lucky enough to keep my amazing hobby going!<br><br>
                With time and curiosity in more craft areas, I started custom resin tumblers, sublimation tumblers, as
                well as vinyl work: stickers,
                custom vinyl t-shirts, sweatshirts and more!<br><br>
                Once I felt confident in these areas, I started doing local craft classes.
                From string art to gnomes, I absolutely loved teaching and sharing my crafting love with those around
                me.<br><br>
                If you would like to shop small, and make an order, I would love to chat with you and create something
                custom and perfect for you.</p>
